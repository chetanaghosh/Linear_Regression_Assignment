## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
- Boom Bikes saw a dip in the number of bike rentals during the Covid era. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- Bike Sharing Dataset


## Conclusions
- From the initial EDA, we understood that the year 2019 was more profitable to the bike sharing company than 2018. We also saw that the temp column had a high correlation with the number of bikes shared. 
- After building and re-building the model, we understood that the top 3 variables that affected the bike rental numbers are year, temperature and light rain/snow (dummy variable created).
